# Moveit-Next

The main idea of the MoveIt is to be a Pomodoro timer and help programmers to be healthy sending challenges to them when the cycle ends. The MoveIt also apply the gamification concept to encourage people to make exercises and increase levels in the game while they are doing their tasks on the computer. This is a project that i did in the NLW 4 event of Rocketseat.
